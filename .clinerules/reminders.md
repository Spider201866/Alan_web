# Cline's Reminders & Rules

This file contains a checklist of important rules and common pitfalls to avoid during development on this project. I MUST read this before starting any task.

## 1. Command-Line Interface (CLI)

-   **PowerShell is the Target Shell**: The user is on Windows PowerShell.
-   **No `&&` for Chaining**: Do not use `&&` to chain commands. It will fail. Execute commands separately.
-   **Use PowerShell-Compatible Commands**:
    -   For recursive file listing, do not use `dir /s /b`. Use `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File` instead.

## 2. File Editing

-   **`replace_in_file` is Fragile**: This tool requires the `SEARCH` block to be an *exact* match of the file content.
    -   After any successful file modification, the internal state of the file has changed. Any subsequent `replace_in_file` call in the same turn **must** be based on the new content, not the original.
    -   For large or complex changes, it is safer and more reliable to use `write_to_file` with the complete, final content of the file.
-   **Always Verify File Content**: Do not assume the content of a file. Use `read_file` before editing if you are unsure of its current state.

## 3. NPM & Node.js

-   **Use `cross-env` for Scripts**: When setting environment variables in `package.json` scripts (like `NODE_OPTIONS`), always prefix the command with `cross-env` to ensure it works on both Windows and Linux/macOS.
-   **Test After Dependency Updates**: After any `npm install` of a new version (especially a major version), immediately run the full test suite (`npm test`) to catch any breaking changes.

---

## 4. General Workflow

-   **Read the Memory Bank**: Always start by reviewing the memory bank files to understand the current project state, architecture, and context.
-   **Update Documentation**: After completing any significant task, update all relevant documentation (`README.md`, `folderList.txt`, and the memory bank files) to reflect the changes.
