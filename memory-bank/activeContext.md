# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
All accessibility, performance, and stability tasks are complete. The project is stable, accessible, and ready for the next phase of development.

## Recent Changes
- **Accessibility Audit & Fixes (June 22, 2025):**
    - **Keyboard Navigation & Focus**: Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard focusable and that focus is managed correctly (e.g., moved to error messages).
    - **ARIA Implementation**: Added appropriate ARIA roles and attributes to custom controls to ensure they are understood by assistive technologies.
    - **Semantic HTML**: Refactored non-semantic elements (like `div`s with click handlers) into more appropriate elements (like `<button>`).
- **Build Fix (June 22, 2025):**
    - Removed the `critical` CSS optimization to resolve build failures.
- **Code Health and Stability (June 22, 2025):**
    - Updated all dependencies and fixed the test suite.

<summary>Archived Changes & Learnings</summary>

- **Documentation Refactor (June 22, 2025):** Pruned and refactored all documentation for clarity.
- **Active Decisions and Considerations**: The project is stable. The remaining `EBUSY` error and sub-dependency deprecation warnings are accepted, known issues.
- **Learnings and Project Insights**:
    - **Deployment Environment Parity**: Build processes can fail in CI/CD even if they work locally.
    - **Pragmatic Retreat**: It's sometimes better to remove a problematic optimization to ensure stability.
    - **Test Environment Management**: Proper test setup and teardown are critical.

## Next Steps
1.  **Implement PWA Service Worker for Install Prompt.**
2.  **Address `EBUSY` error in test cleanup.** (Lower priority)
3.  **Re-evaluate Critical CSS implementation.** (Future task)
