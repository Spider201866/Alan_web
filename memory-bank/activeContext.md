# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The application is stable, fully documented, and feature-complete as a Progressive Web App (PWA). All major bug fixes and performance enhancements from the early July sprint have been completed and documented in the [Progress](progress.md) file.

The current focus is on **maintenance and incremental improvements** as needed. There are no active development sprints.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the application for any new issues.
- Address any user feedback or bug reports.
- Consider minor enhancements to improve user experience or code health.
