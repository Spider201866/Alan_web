# Progress

## What Works

- **Comprehensive Code Documentation (June 28, 2025):**
    - All logical JavaScript files across the project have been documented with JSDoc comments and file-level overviews, significantly improving code clarity and maintainability.
- **Repository Reset (June 28, 2025):**
    - The local and remote repositories were reset to a clean, stable baseline (`fish15-dep`), and the `README.md` was updated to reflect the current project state.
- **UI Improvements (June 25, 2025):**
    - All table cell content in the "View Records" page is now centered both vertically and horizontally for improved readability.
    - The delete (trash can) icon in the records table is now red for better visibility and user experience.
- **Full CSP Compliance and Bug Fixes (June 22, 2025):**
    - Refactored all HTML pages to remove inline scripts, ensuring full Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance.
    - Fixed a bug where non-numeric latitude and longitude values were sent to the backend, causing a 400 Bad Request error.
- **Deployment 404 Error Fixed (June 22, 2025):**
    - Resolved a critical bug where the production server was not serving files from the `dist` directory by updating `routes/web.js` to be environment-aware.
- **Accessibility Audit & Fixes (June 22, 2025):**
    - A full accessibility audit was performed and all identified issues were resolved.
- **Code Health and Stability (June 22, 2025):**
    - All dependencies were updated and the test suite was stabilized.

<summary>Archived Progress (pre-June 22, 2025)</summary>

- **Deployment Issue Diagnosed (June 22, 2025):**
    - After extensive debugging, confirmed that the live deployment on Railway was serving a stale version of the application.
- **Performance Optimization (June 22, 2025):**
    - Implemented a build pipeline for image optimization, asset minification, and Gzip compression. The "Critical CSS" optimization was removed due to build failures.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (June 21, 2025):**
    - The CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and includes an automated build step.
- **Server Refactor & Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):**
    - The server is modular, and data is stored in a persistent SQLite database.

## What's Left to Build
1.  **Implement PWA Service Worker:** The immediate next step is to add a service worker to enable Progressive Web App features, including the ability to install the application.
2.  **Re-evaluate Critical CSS:** A future task is to revisit the implementation of critical CSS to improve the initial page load performance.

## Current Status
The AlanUI Web Chatbot is functional, stable, accessible, and now comprehensively documented. All known issues have been resolved.

## Known Issues
- The `EBUSY` error during test database cleanup still occurs intermittently but does not affect test outcomes.
- Deprecation warnings for sub-dependencies persist as an accepted issue.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Route vs. Static Middleware Precedence (June 22, 2025)**: The root cause of the production 404 error was identified as a route handler taking precedence over the `express.static` middleware. The routing logic was updated to be environment-aware.
- **Accessibility First (June 22, 2025)**: A manual audit was performed to ensure the application meets a high standard of accessibility.
- **Pragmatic Retreat on Critical CSS (June 22, 2025)**: The critical CSS optimization was removed to ensure the application could be successfully deployed.
