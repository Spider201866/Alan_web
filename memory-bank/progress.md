# Progress

## What Works

- **Accessibility Audit & Fixes (June 22, 2025):**
    - **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensured all interactive controls are keyboard focusable and have clear focus states.
    - **ARIA Implementation**: Added appropriate ARIA roles and attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-haspopup`, etc.) to custom controls like dropdowns to convey their state to assistive technologies.
    - **Focus Management**: Implemented logic to programmatically move focus to new content (e.g., error messages) when it appears.
    - **Semantic HTML**: Verified the use of landmark elements (`<main>`, `<nav>`, etc.) for improved page structure.
- **Code Health and Stability (June 22, 2025):**
    - **Jest Deprecation Warnings Fixed**: Refactored UI tests to properly manage the JSDOM lifecycle.
    - **Deprecated Dependencies Investigated**: Confirmed that remaining deprecation warnings stem from sub-dependencies.
    - **Node.js Version Aligned**: Aligned Node.js version across the project and CI/CD pipeline.
    - **Dependency Updates**: Updated all major dependencies to their latest versions.
    - **Test Suite Stability**: Fixed all test failures caused by dependency updates and cross-platform issues.

- **Performance Optimization (June 22, 2025):**
    - Implemented a build pipeline for image optimization (WebP, responsive sizes), asset minification (JS/CSS), and Gzip compression.
    - **Note**: The "Critical CSS" optimization was removed due to build failures in the deployment environment.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (June 21, 2025):**
    - The CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and includes an automated build step.
- **Server Refactor & Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):**
    - The server is modular, and data is stored in a persistent SQLite database.

## What's Left to Build
1.  **Implement PWA Service Worker for Install Prompt.**
2.  **Address `EBUSY` error in test cleanup.** (Lower priority)
3.  **Re-evaluate Critical CSS implementation.** (Future task)

## Current Status
The AlanUI Web Chatbot is functional, stable, and accessible. All recent work on code health, performance, accessibility, and documentation is complete.

## Known Issues
- The `EBUSY` error during test database cleanup still occurs intermittently.
- Deprecation warnings for sub-dependencies persist.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Accessibility First (June 22, 2025)**: A manual audit was performed to ensure the application meets a high standard of accessibility, including keyboard navigation, ARIA implementation, and focus management.
- **Pragmatic Retreat on Critical CSS (June 22, 2025)**: The critical CSS optimization was removed to ensure the application could be successfully deployed.
- **Prioritizing Stability (June 22, 2025)**: A decision was made to pause feature work to address critical dependency warnings and test suite failures.
