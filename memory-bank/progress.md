# Progress

## What Works

- **Code Health and Stability (June 22, 2025):**
    - **Node.js Version**: Aligned Node.js version across the project (`.nvmrc`) and CI/CD pipeline (`20.x`).
    - **Dependency Updates**: Updated all major dependencies to their latest versions.
    - **Test Suite Stability**: Fixed all test failures caused by dependency updates and cross-platform issues.
    - **Clean Test Logs**: Suppressed verbose logging during test runs.
- **Performance Optimization (June 22, 2025):**
    - Implemented a full build pipeline for image optimization, asset minification, and Gzip compression.

- **CI/CD Pipeline (June 21, 2025):**
    - The CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and includes an automated build step.
- **Server Refactor & Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):**
    - The server is modular, and data is stored in a persistent SQLite database.
- **And much more...** (See previous file versions for full details on security, accessibility, testing, etc.)

## What's Left to Build
1.  **Implement PWA Service Worker for Install Prompt.**
2.  **Address `EBUSY` error in test cleanup.** (Lower priority)

## Current Status
The AlanUI Web Chatbot is functional and stable. Recent work focused on improving code health, performance, and documentation.

## Known Issues
- The `EBUSY` error during test database cleanup still occurs intermittently but does not affect test outcomes.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Prioritizing Stability (June 22, 2025)**: A decision was made to pause feature work to address critical dependency warnings and test suite failures.
- **Performance First (June 22, 2025)**: Implemented a formal build process to significantly improve performance.
- **Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):** Migrated from JSON files to a persistent SQLite database.
