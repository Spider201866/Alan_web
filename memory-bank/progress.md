# Progress

## What Works

- **Code Health and Stability (June 22, 2025):**
    - **Jest Deprecation Warnings Fixed**: Refactored UI tests to properly manage the JSDOM lifecycle.
    - **Deprecated Dependencies Investigated**: Confirmed that remaining deprecation warnings stem from sub-dependencies.
    - **Node.js Version Aligned**: Aligned Node.js version across the project and CI/CD pipeline.
    - **Dependency Updates**: Updated all major dependencies to their latest versions.
    - **Test Suite Stability**: Fixed all test failures caused by dependency updates and cross-platform issues.
- **Performance Optimization (June 22, 2025):**
    - Implemented a build pipeline for image optimization (WebP, responsive sizes), asset minification (JS/CSS), and Gzip compression.
    - **Note**: The "Critical CSS" optimization was removed due to build failures in the deployment environment.

- **CI/CD Pipeline (June 21, 2025):**
    - The CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and includes an automated build step.
- **Server Refactor & Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):**
    - The server is modular, and data is stored in a persistent SQLite database.

## What's Left to Build
1.  **Implement PWA Service Worker for Install Prompt.**
2.  **Address `EBUSY` error in test cleanup.** (Lower priority)
3.  **Re-evaluate Critical CSS implementation.** (Future task)

## Current Status
The AlanUI Web Chatbot is functional and stable. All recent work on code health, performance, and documentation is complete.

## Known Issues
- The `EBUSY` error during test database cleanup still occurs intermittently.
- Deprecation warnings for sub-dependencies persist.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Pragmatic Retreat on Critical CSS (June 22, 2025)**: The critical CSS optimization, while beneficial, caused insurmountable build failures in the deployment environment. The decision was made to remove it to ensure the application could be successfully deployed. The other performance optimizations remain in place.
- **Prioritizing Stability (June 22, 2025)**: A decision was made to pause feature work to address critical dependency warnings and test suite failures.
- **Performance First (June 22, 2025)**: Implemented a formal build process to significantly improve performance.
- **Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):** Migrated from JSON files to a persistent SQLite database.
