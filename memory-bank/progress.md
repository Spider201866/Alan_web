# Progress

## What Works

- **Code Health and Stability (June 22, 2025):**
    - **Jest Deprecation Warnings Fixed**: Refactored UI tests (`tests/ui.test.js`) to properly manage the JSDOM lifecycle, resolving `_document` property access warnings.
    - **Deprecated Dependencies Investigated**: Traced `stable`, `inflight`, and `glob` deprecation warnings to sub-dependencies of `jest` and `css-minify`. Confirmed that the top-level packages are fully updated and the issue lies with upstream maintainers.
    - **Node.js Version Aligned**: Aligned Node.js version across the project (`.nvmrc`) and CI/CD pipeline (`20.x`).
    - **Dependency Updates**: Updated all major dependencies to their latest versions.
    - **Test Suite Stability**: Fixed all test failures caused by dependency updates and cross-platform issues.
    - **Clean Test Logs**: Suppressed verbose logging during test runs.

- **Performance Optimization (June 22, 2025):**
    - Implemented a full build pipeline for image optimization, asset minification, and Gzip compression.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (June 21, 2025):**
    - The CI/CD pipeline is fully functional and includes an automated build step.
- **Server Refactor & Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):**
    - The server is modular, and data is stored in a persistent SQLite database.
- **And much more...** (See previous file versions for full details on security, accessibility, testing, etc.)

## What's Left to Build
1.  **Implement PWA Service Worker for Install Prompt.**
2.  **Address `EBUSY` error in test cleanup.** (Lower priority)

## Current Status
The AlanUI Web Chatbot is functional and stable. All recent work on code health, performance, and documentation is complete.

## Known Issues
- The `EBUSY` error during test database cleanup still occurs intermittently but does not affect test outcomes.
- Deprecation warnings for `stable`, `inflight`, and `glob` persist due to their inclusion in upstream dependencies. This is an accepted issue as the direct dependencies are up-to-date.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- **Prioritizing Stability (June 22, 2025)**: A decision was made to pause feature work to address critical dependency warnings and test suite failures. This ensures the project remains on a stable and secure foundation.
- **Performance First (June 22, 2025)**: Implemented a formal build process to significantly improve performance.
- **Data Persistence (June 20, 2025):** Migrated from JSON files to a persistent SQLite database.
